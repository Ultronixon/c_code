# Writing before beginning and test github markdown
---
I am learning C/C++ recently through reading the book < C primer plus > and exercise coding.
so, this will be the first program on github.

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int)
{
    printf("Hello world, hello github!");
    
    return 0;
}
```
